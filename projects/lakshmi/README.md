## Outline

Billions of people around the world still lack access to basic financial
services. We function as a bridge between people in these communities and
people from the cryptocurrency world by offering unsecured, pre-disbursed loans
in a manner similar to kiva.org. We assess the risk of a loan and always
provide the expected value as collateral (probability of repayment times
principal requested). This way, loans are very likely to be filled by the
healthy and growing ecosystem of Dharma relayers.
